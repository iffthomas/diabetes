# diabetes

remarks:

- Last few cells need a strong cpu to run.
- plot dendogram function was taken from your github repo.
- for the histplot of each feature that looks at the clusters and wheter or not a person has diabetes I didn't label #counts on each y-axis because it looked bad
- silhouette coefficient idea was taken from here: https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluating-goodness-of-clustering-for-unsupervised-learning-case-ccebcfd1d4f1
while code block was on the yellowbrick api
