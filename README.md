remarks:

- Last few cells need a strong cpu to run.
- plot dendogram function was taken from your github repo.

Due to the abundance of features, I deleted all that had a correlation of 1 with each one since they won't improve the model. This is my main concern wheter or not this is actually okay to do. Furthermore all missing values got dropped immediatly, It's a shame that the Liver inflammation Factor was mostly nan because because it could have also a signigicant contribution in a classifier as we can see in the correlation matrix.
